#Week 1

##A Brief Introduction to Data Mining
What is data mining? Extracting knowledge from data. 

###Data processing workflow
* Data acquisition
* Data preprocessing (cleaning, normalizing, features selection, dimensionality reduction)
* Data selection
* Data Mining (pattern discovery, classification, clustering, outlier analysis)
* Pattern evaluation (selection, evaluation, visualization) 

###Types of data
* Structured and semi-structured
	* Data warehouse
	* Relation data/object relation data
	* Transactional data
* Unstructured data
	* Text
	* Web
	* Spatial and spatio-temporal data
	* Multimedia
	* Data streams and sensory data
	* Time series data, temporal data 
	* graphs, social network, information networks

###Knowledge view
What kind of pattens that is knowledge are we extracting?
* patters
* classification and predictive modeling
* Clusters (unsupervised learning)
* Outlier analysis
* Trends and evolution analysis

###Application view
* Mining text and web
* Biological & medical data
* Financial & business data
* Social networks data
* Software programs data

###Book Recommendations
####Text books on Data Mining:
* Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei, Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques.
Morgan Kaufmann, 3rd ed. , 2011
* Mohammed J. Zaki and Wagner Meira, Jr., Data Mining and Analysis: Fundamental
Concepts and Algorithms, Cambridge University Press, 2014
* Pang-Ning Tan, Michael Steinbach and Vipin Kumar, Introduction to Data Mining, 2nd
ed., Wiley, 2014

####Reference book on Pattern Discovery:
* Charu Aggarwal and Jiawei Han (eds.), Frequent Pattern Mining, Springer, 2014

##Pattern discovery basics
* Pattern
* Frequent pattern and association rules. Frequency of (X & Y) and (Y|X) 
* Closed Pattern - there exist no super pattern with same frequency
* Max Pattern - there exist no super pattern exceeding threshold
