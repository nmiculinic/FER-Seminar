#Stat 2X.1
[MOOC](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-statistics-descriptive-uc-berkeleyx-stat2-1x)

##Week 1
###Variable
* quantitative
	* discrete
	* continuous
* categorical | qualitative
	* color
	* race
* qualitative ordinal
	* temperature - cold, mild, hot

###Bar Graph

###Stem and Leaf plot

###Distribution table
In intervals data clustering left endpoint included, right excluded. Outliers concatenated into endpoint buckets.

###Histogram
*Area* of the bar = *percent* in the intervals

###Percentiles
p-th percentile is value such that p percent of the data is less or equal then. When assessing percentiles within histograms we assume values are uniformly distributed with a bar.
* 25th percentile = lower quartile
* 50th percentile = median
* 75th percentile = upper quartile

The pth percentile of a list of numbers is the smallest number that is at
least as large as p% of the list.

##Week 2
###Common terms
* Mean == expected value of random variable??
* Mode == value with highest frequency
* Unimodal distribution has only one peak. Does that mean pdf or pmf are concave??

###Acquiring data
* Longitudinal studies -- acquiring data by following same subject for some time
* Cross sectional studies -- acquiring data by cross secting subjects at different age.

###Average vs. Median
* Median unaffected by outliers
* Right-skewed distribution (right hand tail) - average > median
* Left-skewed distribution (left hand tail)   - average < median
* percentile and averages does not necessarily relate. They depend on underlying distribution

###Markov inequality
